Teaching others as a way of learning a subject.

"if you want to learn something, then the best thng to do is to find or create a group of people who really, really depend on you learning it"

I want to learn about perturbation analysis. Who am I teaching? Group of Hacker
Schoolers? People with some background in mathematics. M?

> The Mini-Textbook Method

When faced with a course with large volumes of complicated material, reduce your
notes to a collection of textbook-style chapters. Write these like a real
textbook. That is, use complete sentences and logical explanations. (You don’t,
however, have to waste time on making the writing “good” or, even, grammatically
sound. It’s only for you.)

> Your goal should be to reduce and synthesize. A good rule of thumb is to have
> at most one succinct chapter per each week of notes.

- A high-level description of the concepts covered in the chapter.
- A list of definitions.
- Good, succinct descriptions of the big ideas, theories, or frameworks.
A discussion of how the different elements from the previous item connect or
compare and contrast.

HOW

>  ‘Feynman Technique’. Scott Young makes a great job of explaining it, or
>  Learning on Steroids as he charmingly calls it.

Here’s an overview:

Choose your concept
Pretend your teaching it to a new student
Whenever you get stuck, go back to the books
Simplify wordy bits or create analogies

Subject: Singular perturbation analysis
Pretend teaching: Ok.
Stuck: Got materials.
